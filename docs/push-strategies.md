# Push Strategies

rules_img supports multiple push strategies optimized for different scenarios. Each strategy offers unique trade-offs between performance, infrastructure requirements, and use cases.

## Eager Push

### Overview
The eager push strategy is the traditional approach where all image layers are downloaded to the machine running Bazel and then uploaded to the target registry. This is similar to how most container build tools work, including rules_oci.

### How it Works
1. Downloads all required blobs (layers, configs, manifests) to local machine
2. Uploads all blobs to the target registry
3. Writes the manifest to the registry

### Diagram
![Eager Push Strategy](visuals/eager-push-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![Eager Push Strategy](visuals/eager-push-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

### Pros
- ✅ Simple and straightforward
- ✅ Works with any standard container registry
- ✅ No special infrastructure required (works without remote cache)
- ✅ Predictable behavior

### Cons
- ❌ Requires downloading all layers locally
- ❌ Uses significant bandwidth for large images
- ❌ Slower for images with many or large layers
- ❌ Not optimized for remote execution

### Setup Guide
```bash
# Enable eager push strategy (this is the default)
$ bazel run //your:push_target --@rules_img//img/settings:push_strategy=eager

# Or set in .bazelrc
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_strategy=eager
```

No additional infrastructure setup required.

## Lazy Push

### Overview
The lazy push strategy optimizes uploads by checking the registry first and only uploading missing blobs. It streams blobs directly from Bazel's remote cache when needed, avoiding unnecessary downloads to the local machine.

### How it Works
1. Downloads only image metadata to machine running Bazel
2. Streams missing blobs from Bazel's remote cache to the registry
3. Writes the manifest to the registry

### Diagram
![Lazy Push Strategy](visuals/lazy-push-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![Lazy Push Strategy](visuals/lazy-push-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

### Pros
- ✅ Work with huge container images without sacrificing local disk space
- ✅ Works with standard registries
- ✅ Supports Build without the Bytes

### Cons
- ❌ Requires a Bazel remote cache
- ❌ Slightly more complex than eager push
- ❌ Push fails if required blobs are evicted from the CAS before the push runs (see [Remote Cache Eviction](#remote-cache-eviction))
- ❌ Requires `--digest_function=sha256` (the default; see [Digest Function](#digest-function))

### Setup Guide
1. Ensure you have a Bazel remote cache configured:
```bash
# Example remote cache configuration.
# This also works with --remote_executor
build --remote_cache=grpc://your-cache-server:9092
```

2. Enable lazy push strategy:
```bash
# In .bazelrc
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_strategy=lazy

# Optionally, configure remote cache and credential helper via rules_img settings
# instead of environment variables:
common --@rules_img//img/settings:remote_cache=grpc://your-cache-server:9092
common --@rules_img//img/settings:credential_helper=tweag-credential-helper

# If your remote cache requires a remote instance name, set it here:
common --@rules_img//img/settings:remote_instance_name=my-instance-name
```

> See [Credential Helpers](credential-helpers.md) for exactly how
> `credential_helper` / `IMG_CREDENTIAL_HELPER` is used to authenticate this
> remote-cache traffic. To scope a helper to the cache without affecting
> registry auth, use `credential_helper_remote_cache` /
> `IMG_CREDENTIAL_HELPER_REMOTE_CACHE` instead.

3. Run your push target:
```bash
# Configure the push utility via environment variables:
export IMG_REAPI_ENDPOINT=grpc://your-cache-server:9092
export IMG_CREDENTIAL_HELPER=tweag-credential-helper
# Set the remote instance name if required by your RBE backend:
export IMG_REAPI_INSTANCE_NAME=my-instance-name
bazel run //your:push_target

# Or use the settings flags (if configured above):
bazel run //your:push_target
```

4. (Optional) Use the local Bazel disk cache as an additional blob source:
```bash
export IMG_DISK_CACHE=$(bazel info disk_cache)
bazel run //your:push_target
```

When `IMG_DISK_CACHE` is set, rules_img reads blobs directly from the local Bazel
disk cache before falling back to the remote CAS, and blobs it fetches from the
remote CAS are written back into that directory (see
[Local blob cache](#local-blob-cache) below). This can speed up pushes on
developer machines that have a warm disk cache.

> **Note:** As an additional *source*, this has little effect in most setups:
> - With **Build without the Bytes** (BwoB) enabled, Bazel does not download action
>   outputs to the disk cache, so the cache will be mostly empty for recently-built
>   layers. Blobs that rules_img itself fetched are there, though.
> - If you are **not using lazy push** (for example, with the eager strategy), all
>   blobs are already materialized as runfiles and the disk cache is never consulted.

### Local blob cache

Every blob `img deploy` reads from the remote CAS goes through a local cache. It
does two things:

- **Deduplicates reads.** Concurrent readers of one blob — the same layer pushed to
  several registries, or a compact layer's input file referenced by several layers —
  share a single download. A reader that arrives while a download is in flight
  streams the bytes as they arrive instead of starting a second one.
- **Keeps blobs on disk**, in Bazel's disk cache layout (`cas/<xx>/<digest>`), so a
  later push — including a later `bazel run`, and Bazel itself when the directory is
  its disk cache — reads them locally instead of from the remote CAS.

By default the cache lives in a `rules_img` directory inside the user cache
directory (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `~/.cache` on Linux, `~/Library/Caches` on macOS,
`%LocalAppData%` on Windows) and is capped at 10 GiB, evicting the least recently
used blobs beyond that. Setting `IMG_DISK_CACHE` moves it into Bazel's disk cache,
which shares the blobs with Bazel.

Local caching never changes the outcome of a deploy: if the directory cannot be
written, fills up, or is unavailable, the affected read falls back to streaming
straight from the remote CAS.

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `IMG_CAS_CACHE` | Set to `0`, `false`, `off` or `no` to disable local caching (and read deduplication) entirely |
| `IMG_CAS_CACHE_DIR` | Cache directory, overriding both the default and `IMG_DISK_CACHE` |
| `IMG_CAS_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` | Maximum cached bytes, e.g. `20GiB`. `0` means unlimited |
| `IMG_CAS_CACHE_BUFFER_SIZE` | How much of a blob is written to disk before readers can consume it (default `1MiB`) |

A size limit means rules_img manages that directory: it indexes what is already
there on startup and prunes it. A directory you name — your own, or Bazel's disk
cache — has no limit by default, so rules_img only ever adds to it and leaves
pruning to Bazel's own disk cache garbage collection. It does evict blobs it wrote
itself if the file system runs out of space.

`img deploy` reports what the cache did after each deploy:

```
    blob transfers: 3 from disk, 0 from disk cache, 0 from container registry, 5 from remote cache, 0 from compact stream
    remote cache blobs: 2 from local cache (48.1 MiB), 3 fetched (210.4 MiB), 1 deduplicated, 0 evicted
```

## CAS Registry Push

### Overview
The CAS (Content Addressable Storage) registry push strategy uses a special container registry that is directly integrated with Bazel's remote cache. This eliminates data duplication and provides the fastest possible push performance. Please note that the remote cache may evict cached data at any time, as per [the specification][reapi-spec-cas-lifetime]. For that reason, using a remote cache as the backend of your container registry is only recommended during development.
Also note that the registry doesn't offer TLS nor authentication, so it should only listen on localhost, or be protected by a VPN or other gateway.

### How it Works
1. The special registry reads blobs directly from Bazel's CAS
2. No blob transfer needed - registry and cache share storage
3. Only metadata (manifests) need to be written
4. Registry serves blobs on-demand from CAS

### Diagram
![CAS Registry Push Strategy](visuals/cas-registry-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![CAS Registry Push Strategy](visuals/cas-registry-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

### Pros
- ✅ Fastest push performance possible
- ✅ Zero data duplication
- ✅ Minimal bandwidth usage
- ✅ Perfect for development workflows
- ✅ Ideal for CI pipelines where images are tested shortly after a build

### Cons
- ❌ Requires special registry implementation
- ❌ More complex infrastructure setup
- ❌ Registry must have access to CAS
- ❌ Requires `--digest_function=sha256` (the default; see [Digest Function](#digest-function))
- ❌ Images stop being pullable if the CAS evicts a layer underneath them (see [`--cas-keepalive`](#bounding-what-the-registry-keeps-and-keeping-blobs-alive))

### Setup Guide
1. Deploy the CAS-integrated registry using the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  ghcr.io/bazel-contrib/rules_img/cas-registry:latest \
  --reapi-endpoint grpc://your-cas-server:9092 \
  --credential-helper tweag-credential-helper \
  --address 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 80 \
  --grpc-port 4444 \
  --enable-blobcache \
  --blob-store reapi
```

Alternatively, build from source:
```bash
# Build the registry
bazel build @rules_img_tool//cmd/registry

# Start registry server
bazel-bin/external/rules_img_tool+/cmd/registry/registry_/registry \
  --reapi-endpoint grpc://your-cas-server:9092 \
  --credential-helper tweag-credential-helper \
  --address localhost \
  --port 80 \
  --grpc-port 4444 \
  --enable-blobcache \
  --blob-store reapi
```

2. Configure Bazel to use CAS registry push:
```bash
# In .bazelrc
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_strategy=cas_registry
# This also works with --remote_executor
build --remote_cache=grpc://your-cache-server:9092

# Optionally, configure credential helper via rules_img settings:
common --@rules_img//img/settings:credential_helper=tweag-credential-helper
```

> See [Credential Helpers](credential-helpers.md) — the same
> credential helper behavior from the lazy strategy applies here.

3. Push to your CAS registry:
```bash
export IMG_BLOB_CACHE_ENDPOINT=grpc://localhost:4444
bazel run //your:push_target
```

The registry can use multiple blob backends, including a remote cache (`reapi`, default), another container registry (`upstream`), and an S3 bucket (`s3`). Those backends are experimental.

### Bounding what the registry keeps, and keeping blobs alive

The registry keeps every manifest it is pushed until the process exits, and serves
blobs the CAS may evict at any time. `--ttl` bounds the first by garbage collecting
manifests and blobs by tracing references, so nothing a tag or an unexpired index still
names is ever collected. `--cas-keepalive` handles the second by periodically asking
the cache about the blobs live manifests reference, which keeps a cache that evicts by
least recent use from dropping them.

```bash
registry --blob-store reapi --reapi-endpoint grpc://your-cas-server:9092 \
  --ttl 6h --cas-keepalive
```

### Keeping manifests across restarts

By default the registry holds manifests and tags in memory, so a restart forgets every
image until it is pushed again. `--manifest-store s3` writes each manifest and tag
through to S3 before acknowledging the push, and reloads them on start:

```bash
registry --blob-store reapi --reapi-endpoint grpc://your-cas-server:9092 \
  --manifest-store s3 --manifest-s3-bucket my-bucket --manifest-s3-prefix cas-registry \
  --s3-region us-east-1 --ttl 168h --cas-keepalive
```

Blobs still come from the CAS; S3 holds only manifests (`<prefix>/manifests/<repo>/<alg>/<hex>`)
and tags (`<prefix>/tags/<repo>/<tag>`). Run one registry per prefix: the store assumes it is
the only writer. Garbage collection deletes the S3 objects of whatever it collects.

See [Garbage collection](../img_tool/pkg/registry/garbage-collection.md) for every
flag, what the retention rules actually are, and how to size the keepalive.

## BES Push

### Overview
The BES (Build Event Service) push strategy performs image pushes as a side-effect of Bazel's build event uploads. This is the most sophisticated strategy, designed for large organizations with thousands of builds per day.
Note that the BES service doesn't offer TLS nor authentication, so it should only listen on localhost, or be protected by a VPN or other gateway.

### How it Works
1. Bazel uploads build events to BES as normal
2. BES backend detects image push events
3. Images are assembled and pushed asynchronously
4. No client-side push needed

### Diagram
![BES Push Strategy](visuals/bes-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![BES Push Strategy](visuals/bes-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

### Pros
- ✅ Zero client-side overhead
- ✅ Pushes happen asynchronously
- ✅ Extremely scalable
- ✅ Perfect for large organizations
- ✅ Centralized push management

### Cons
- ❌ Requires custom BES backend
- ❌ Most complex setup
- ❌ Requires significant infrastructure
- ❌ Requires `--digest_function=sha256` (the default; see [Digest Function](#digest-function))

### Setup Guide
1. Deploy the BES backend using the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  ghcr.io/bazel-contrib/rules_img/bes-listener:latest \
  --address 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8080 \
  --cas-endpoint grpc://your-cas-server:9092 \
  --credential-helper tweag-credential-helper
```

Alternatively, build from source:
```bash
# Build the BES server
bazel build @rules_img_tool//cmd/bes

# Run with CAS backend
bazel-bin/external/rules_img_tool+/cmd/bes/bes_/bes \
  --address localhost \
  --port 8080 \
  --cas-endpoint grpc://your-cas-server:9092 \
  --credential-helper tweag-credential-helper
```

2. Configure Bazel to use your BES:
```bash
# In .bazelrc
build --bes_backend=grpc://localhost:8080
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_strategy=bes
```

3. Build your targets normally - pushes happen automatically:
```bash
# Just build - no need to run push targets!
bazel build //your:image_target
```

## Push at Build Time

Push at build time is not a push *strategy* — it is an orthogonal option that can
be combined with the strategies above. Instead of pushing when you run a push
target, it pushes image content to the registry *as part of the build itself*.

### Overview
When `push_at_build_time` is enabled, every `image_manifest` / `image_index` that
has `push_specs`, as well as every `image_push` target, gains extra build actions
(mnemonic `PushImage`) that upload content directly to the registry: one action
per image blob (each layer and each config), plus — unless the content mode is
`blobs` — one more action per push that writes the config and manifest(s). The
actions' outputs are always placed in a `push_at_build_time` output group and, by
default, additionally wired as Bazel [validation actions], so they run whenever
the target is built (with `--run_validations`, on by default) without sitting on
the critical path of the target's normal outputs. See [Toggling the push without
losing the analysis cache](#toggling-the-push-without-losing-the-analysis-cache)
for the alternative.

`multi_deploy` has no push at build time of its own — it deploys at `bazel run`
time. The `image_push` targets (or images with `push_specs`) it references still
push at build time on their own when the setting is enabled; `multi_deploy` does
not push them a second time.

Three content modes are available, selected with `push_at_build_time_content`:

- **`blobs`** — every image blob is pushed at build time: one `PushImage` action
  per layer and one per config blob. The manifest(s)/tags are *not* pushed at build
  time; you write them afterwards with `image_push` / `multi_deploy`.
- **`blobs_and_manifests`** — layers, config, and manifest(s) are pushed at build
  time, but only *by digest*: no tag is written. The image is complete and pullable
  by digest as soon as the build finishes, while the tags stay unchanged until you
  run `image_push` / `multi_deploy`.
- **`all`** (default) — layers, config, and manifest(s)/tags are all pushed at
  build time. The image exists in the registry under its tags as soon as the build
  finishes; no separate push step is required.

[validation actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions

### Diagram
The content modes are illustrated below (see [Modes in detail](#modes-in-detail)
for the reasoning behind each).

**`blobs`** — all image blobs (layers and the config) are pushed from the build
cluster at build time; the manifest(s)/tags are pushed afterwards:

![Push at build time (blobs)](visuals/push-at-build-time-blobs-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![Push at build time (blobs)](visuals/push-at-build-time-blobs-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

**`all`** — the whole image (layers, config, manifest and tags) is
pushed from the build cluster at build time. `blobs_and_manifests` is the same
picture minus the tag write:

![Push at build time (blobs and manifests)](visuals/push-at-build-time-all-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![Push at build time (blobs and manifests)](visuals/push-at-build-time-all-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

### Why push at build time?
The clearest win: **all layers are uploaded in parallel, directly from the remote
execution cluster to the registry**. When the `PushImage` actions run on a remote
executor, each layer is uploaded by its own action from the worker that already
holds the blob — so the layer bytes never flow through the machine running Bazel.
This is especially valuable for large images and high-fan-out CI.

### Modes in detail

#### Blobs at build time, manifest afterwards (`blobs`)
Pair this mode with the [lazy push strategy](#lazy-push). Because every blob (all
layers and the config) is already uploaded at build time, the follow-up
`image_push` / `multi_deploy` only has to write the manifest — and with the lazy
strategy the layer tarballs are never materialized on, or downloaded to, the
machine running Bazel. The net effect: blobs are uploaded once, in parallel, from
the build cluster, and Bazel never touches layer bytes.

Since the blobs are already in the registry, tell the follow-up push to reference
them instead of re-uploading:

```bash
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time=enabled
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time_content=blobs
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_strategy=lazy
# Make `bazel run` deploy refuse to re-upload layers; it only mounts / HEADs them.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:forbid_layer_push=enabled
```

Optionally push the blobs to a shared staging repository and have the manifest push
cross-mount them into each image's real repository with
`--@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time_blob_repository=<repo>`. In the
`blobs_and_manifests` and `all` modes you can additionally stage the manifests
themselves in a separate repository with
`--@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time_manifest_repository=<repo>`; this
only redirects where the build-time manifest push writes the manifest(s) and config
— the layer blobs are still cross-mounted from the blob repository.

Registries expose a blob to any repository the caller can read, so the manifest push
does not have to re-upload the layers it finds in the staging repository — it
cross-mounts them (`POST /v2/<image>/blobs/uploads/?mount=<digest>&from=<staging>`),
which the registry resolves internally by linking the existing blob:

![Cross-mounting blobs (multi-tenant)](visuals/blob-mount-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![Cross-mounting blobs (multi-tenant)](visuals/blob-mount-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

This split is also a good fit for **multi-tenant** setups, because blob uploads and
manifest/tag writes use *different* credentials. In most cases it is acceptable to
hand every user of the remote execution cluster a shared machine account that may
*upload* blobs (`HEAD` / `POST` / `PUT` to `/v2/.../blobs/`) but may not read
existing blobs or write manifests. Any user can then upload every image blob (all
layers and the config) at build time with that restricted machine account, while
the manifest and tags are written afterwards with the individual (local) Bazel
user's own credentials. A leaked or misused build-action credential can then only
add blobs — it cannot read other tenants' layers or publish images under their tags.

#### Untagged manifests at build time (`blobs_and_manifests`)
A middle ground between the two modes above: the build action pushes every blob
*and* the manifest(s)/index, but writes them by digest only — no tag is created at
build time. The complete image is pullable by digest the moment the build finishes,
yet the tags a deployment reads keep pointing at whatever was deployed last until
you `bazel run` the `image_push` / `multi_deploy` target.

Use it when the tag is the thing you don't want a build to move: the registry holds
the content (so the follow-up push only writes tags — it detects the manifests are
already present and does a `HEAD` instead of an upload), but simply building a
target never publishes it under a name.

Combine it with `push_at_build_time_manifest_repository` to keep the untagged
manifests out of the image's real repository as well.

#### Everything at build time (`all`)
The image is fully pushed by the time the build action finishes — the simplest to
operate, but harder to reason about: there is no push step to watch, you don't see
what was pushed, and the image already exists (under its tags) once the build action
completes.

If you still need the digest and tags afterwards (for example to feed a downstream
deployment), you can run `image_push` or `multi_deploy` in this mode. They detect
that everything is already present, do a lightweight `HEAD` request instead of
uploading, and print the resulting digest and tags.

> **Signing always happens client-side.** Push at build time never signs images —
> the `PushImage` build actions only upload content. Image signing (see
> [Image Signing](image-signing.md)) is performed by `img deploy` when you
> `bazel run` an `image_push` / `multi_deploy` target, using the configured signer
> plugin and your local credentials. So even when the whole image is already in the
> registry via `all`, producing a *signed* image still requires the
> `bazel run` deploy step: it detects the content is already present (a lightweight
> `HEAD` instead of an upload) and then attaches the signature as an OCI referrer.

### Requirements and trade-offs
Pushing from a build action has the same infrastructure needs as lazy base image
pulls (`layer_handling`), plus write access:

- ❌ Build actions need **network access** to the registry (like lazy
  `layer_handling`), which makes them non-hermetic.
- ❌ Build actions need **registry credentials with write access** (lazy
  `layer_handling` only needs read). See
  [Authenticating Build Actions](authenticating-build-actions.md) for how to give
  pull/push actions their credentials.
- ❌ Harder to reason about than an explicit push step, especially in
  `all` mode (see above).

### Setup Guide
```bash
# Enable push at build time. "best_effort" logs push failures but keeps the build
# green; "enabled" fails the build if a push fails; "disabled" (default) is off.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time=enabled

# Choose what to push: "blobs" (all layers and the config), "blobs_and_manifests"
# (additionally the manifest(s), by digest only) or "all" (default: also the tags).
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time_content=all
```

Then just build the image target — the push happens as a validation action:
```bash
bazel build //your:image_target
```

### Toggling the push without losing the analysis cache
`push_at_build_time` is a build setting, so flipping it between invocations
changes the build configuration and makes Bazel discard its analysis cache. For a
push you want to turn on and off per invocation — push on CI, don't push locally;
one `bazel build` of a large target tree with the push, another without — that
re-analysis is the dominant cost.

The outputs of the `PushImage` actions always live in a regular
`push_at_build_time` output group, which is *not* part of the configuration: a
build only runs the pushes when it asks for that output group. Set

```bash
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time=enabled
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time_output_group=push_at_build_time
```

once in your `.bazelrc`, and the push actions stay in the action graph but idle:

```bash
# No push: the push_at_build_time output group is not requested.
bazel build //your:image_target

# Push, reusing the same analysis cache.
bazel build --output_groups=+push_at_build_time //your:image_target
```

With the default `push_at_build_time_output_group=validation`, the outputs are
additionally placed in Bazel's implicit `_validation` output group, so the pushes
run on every build of the target (and `--norun_validations` turns them off
wholesale, for every validation action in the build, not just the pushes).

### Per-target configuration
The global flags above set the baseline; each `image_push` target and each
`image_push_spec` (the push config attached to an `image_manifest` / `image_index`
via `push_specs`) can override push at build time on its own. The relevant
attributes default to deferring to the global flag, so unset targets behave
exactly as before:

| Attribute | Default | Overrides global flag |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `push_at_build_time` | `auto` | `push_at_build_time` |
| `push_at_build_time_content` | `auto` | `push_at_build_time_content` |
| `push_at_build_time_blob_repository` | *(sentinel)* | `push_at_build_time_blob_repository` |
| `push_at_build_time_manifest_repository` | *(sentinel)* | `push_at_build_time_manifest_repository` |
| `forbid_layer_push` | `auto` | `forbid_layer_push` |
| `deduplicated_push` | `auto` | `deduplicated_push` |
| `deduplicated_push_blob_repository` | *(sentinel)* | `deduplicated_push_blob_repository` |
| `deduplicated_push_content` | `auto` | `deduplicated_push_content` |
| `push_at_build_time_exec_properties` | `{"requires-network": "1"}` | *(none — per-target only)* |

`auto` (and the repository sentinel) means "use the global setting"; any other
value is used verbatim — for the repository attributes, `""` forces "no staging
repository" even when the global flag is set. `push_at_build_time_exec_properties`
is forwarded as the `execution_requirements` of every `PushImage` action, so you
can, for example, route the network-bound push actions to a specific remote
execution pool per target.

```python
load("@rules_img//img:push.bzl", "image_push_spec")

# This image pushes at build time to a staging repository and refuses to
# re-upload layers on a later `bazel run`, regardless of the global default.
image_push_spec(
    name = "push_spec",
    registry = "gcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/my-app",
    tag = "latest",
    push_at_build_time = "enabled",
    push_at_build_time_content = "blobs",
    push_at_build_time_blob_repository = "my-project/_staging",
    forbid_layer_push = "enabled",
)
```

Because the staging repository is only used for cross-mounting when push at build
time actually runs, setting `push_at_build_time_blob_repository` while
`push_at_build_time` is `disabled` for a target records **no** cross-mount source
in that target's deploy manifest — a later `bazel run` deploy will not try to
mount blobs from a repository nothing was pushed to.


## Deduplicated Push

> **Requires a registry that shares a blob between repositories.** The whole point is
> to upload a shared blob once and have every other repository get it from there, so on
> a registry that does neither of the two things that can make that work, a push that

> [Registry requirements](#registry-requirements) below for how to check yours.

### The problem
The OCI spec lets a registry keep a **separate blob store per repository name**: a
blob uploaded to `/v2/team/service-a/blobs/` need not be visible from
`/v2/team/service-b/blobs/`. Some registries do exactly that.

go-containerregistry dedupes blob uploads per repository — each repository gets its
own writer with its own "did I already upload this digest" bookkeeping. That is the
right granularity for a registry with one shared blob store, where the second upload
is skipped after a cheap `HEAD`. On a registry with per-repository storage it means
that pushing K images that share their base layers to K *different* repository names
uploads every shared layer K times:

```
base image layer   ┐
shared layer 1     │ identical across every service
...                │
shared layer N     ┘
layer for service X  ← the only layer that differs
```

### The strategy
`--@rules_img//img/settings:deduplicated_push=enabled` makes `img deploy` push in
phases instead of pushing each manifest independently:

1. **Ask what is already there.** Every manifest the deploy intends to write is
   `HEAD`ed in parallel (bounded by `--jobs`). A manifest the registry already holds
   at the expected digest contributes nothing: a registry that has a manifest has the
   blobs it references.
2. **Find a mount source for each shared blob, in each registry.** A blob store and
   a cross-mount both live inside one registry, so this is decided per (registry,
   blob): for every layer of the still-missing manifests, among the repositories of
   *that* registry, in order of preference:
   1. **A repository the registry already serves a manifest from.** Step 1 just
      confirmed that manifest, and a registry that serves a manifest holds the blobs
      it references — so the blob is already there and **nothing is uploaded at
      all**. When one service out of many changed, this covers every shared layer.
   2. **A repository the build recorded the layer as coming from**, i.e. a shallow
      base image's own repository.
   3. **Otherwise one of the destinations itself** — the first alphabetically — which
      becomes the blob's *home repository* in that registry. No configuration and no
      extra repository: the home is somewhere the deploy was going to push anyway, so
      it needs no credentials beyond the ones it already has.

   [`deduplicated_push_blob_repository`](#pinning-the-home-repository) replaces all
   three with a repository you name.
3. **Upload what has nowhere to come from.** Blobs that fell through to (iii) are
   uploaded to their home repository — once, however many repositories need them.
   Uploads are `HEAD`ed first, so re-running a deploy costs one request per blob
   instead of a re-upload. In
   [`blobs_and_artificial_manifests`](#registries-that-will-not-mount) mode a config
   blob and a manifest referencing the blob follow it into the home repository.
4. **Mount.** The manifest push then cross-mounts each blob out of its source.
   For a blob this deploy uploaded to its home, that mount is *strict*: the deploy
   put it there, so being asked for the blob's bytes means the mount failed and the
   push fails loudly instead of silently uploading into every repository. For (i)
   and (ii) the mount rests on an inference rather than on something the deploy did,
   so the ordinary byte-upload fallback stays in place — if the blob turns out to be
   gone, uploading it is the right recovery. So does everything under `best_effort`.
5. **Write manifests and tags** as usual.

So a first push of `foo` and `bar` uploads a layer they share to `bar` (first
alphabetically) and mounts it into `foo`. A later push where only `foo` changed
uploads nothing for that layer at all: `bar`'s manifest is still there, so the layer
is mounted straight out of it. Net effect on a registry with per-repository blob
storage: at most one upload per (registry, blob) instead of one per (repository,
blob).

This is the upload-side counterpart to the [local blob cache](#local-blob-cache),
which collapses the *downloads* of a layer pushed to several repositories into one.
The two compose: a cross-mounted layer's bytes are never read at all, so the
deduplicated push removes those repeated reads instead of leaving them for the cache
to serve. Whichever one you turn off, the other still does its half.

```bash
# The default for every push target.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:deduplicated_push=enabled
```

Each `image_push` and `image_push_spec` can override that default with its own
`deduplicated_push` attribute (`auto` — the default — defers to the global flag):

```python
image_push(
    name = "push_app",
    image = ":app",
    registry = "reg.example.com",
    repository = "team/app",
    deduplicated_push = "enabled",
)
```

`img deploy --deduplicated-push=enabled|best_effort|disabled` overrides both at run
time.

### Registry requirements
The strategy rests on one request being answered the way the spec allows but does not
require:

```
POST /v2/<repository>/blobs/uploads/?mount=<digest>&from=<other-repository>
→ 201 Created
```

A registry that will not mount answers `202 Accepted` instead — "start uploading" —
and go-containerregistry proceeds with the upload session it was handed, asking the
layer for its bytes (on an outright error status it retries without the mount, which
lands in the same place). For a blob **this deploy** uploaded to its home repository,
those bytes are refused and the push fails, naming the repository the blob was
uploaded to:

```
refusing to upload layer sha256:…: it was uploaded to "team/service-a" for
cross-mounting, so being asked for its bytes means the registry refused to mount it
from there; the registry may not support cross-repository blob mounts, or may not let
this credential read that repository
```

That is deliberate. A silent fallback would upload every shared layer into every
repository *after* having already uploaded it to the home repository — strictly worse
than never enabling the strategy — and it would hide the fact that the setting is
doing nothing. The two mount sources the deploy only *infers* (a repository whose
manifest the registry already serves, and a recorded upstream repository) keep the
ordinary byte-upload fallback, because there the blob may genuinely have been deleted
and uploading it is the right recovery. So does everything under
[`best_effort`](#not-depending-on-it-best_effort), which is that fallback chosen on
purpose and with the cost understood.

Which registries mount is therefore the deciding question — or, where they do not,
whether they [share a blob a manifest references](#registries-that-will-not-mount)
instead. See the [registry support matrix](registry-support.md) for what we know about
specific ones, and its
[probe recipe](registry-support.md#testing-a-registry-yourself) for checking yours
with a handful of `curl` calls against throwaway repositories.

A few more things worth knowing before enabling it:

- **It only pays off where blob storage is per repository.** If a registry answers
  `HEAD /v2/<other>/blobs/<digest>` with `200` for a blob uploaded under a different
  name, the ordinary push already skips the second upload — enabling this changes
  nothing except adding a manifest `HEAD` per destination.
- **Mount sources need read access.** A registry checks that the caller may read the
  `from` repository, and go-containerregistry asks its token service for that access
  only when the source names the destination's own registry — which these sources
  always do, so the pull scope is requested. A credential scoped to exactly one
  repository per image still cannot mount between them.
- **Mounts never cross registries.** A source is always a repository in the
  destination's own registry, so the strategy never depends on cross-registry
  mounting, which few registries implement. The `origin=<registry>` parameter
  go-containerregistry adds alongside `from` names that same registry — the request
  `crane copy` makes between two repositories of one registry. Docker Hub is
  therefore not a special case: it mounts within itself like any other registry, and
  the mount go-containerregistry refuses to send there
  ([#1741](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/issues/1741)) is only the
  one whose source names a *different* registry.

### Not depending on it: `best_effort`
`enabled` insists on the deduplication: a blob this deploy uploaded to a home
repository is served to the manifest push as a *mount-only* layer, so being asked for
its bytes fails the push (see [Registry requirements](#registry-requirements) for why
that is the right default). `best_effort` keeps everything about the strategy except
that insistence:

- A refused mount falls back to uploading the layer's bytes, exactly as a push without
  the strategy would.
- A failed upload to a home repository is a warning; that blob gives up its
  cross-mount and is pushed the ordinary way.
- Nothing else changes: the existence check, the planning and the configuration
  validation still fail loudly, because those are not the registry disagreeing with an
  assumption.

The trade is what it sounds like: on a registry that shares blobs, `best_effort` costs
nothing and does the same work as `enabled`; on one that does not, it silently pays the
uploads the strategy meant to avoid instead of telling you the setting is doing nothing.
Use it when you cannot probe the registry ahead of time (or when different destinations
of one deploy differ), and `enabled` when you can.

A blob shared between an `enabled` and a `best_effort` operation is treated as
`best_effort`: whether a layer may be uploaded is a property of the per-registry view
of the blobs, so it cannot be strict for one destination and lenient for the other, and
the operation that asked never to fail is the one honored.

### Registries that will not mount
Some registries refuse every cross-repository mount and still share blobs — just not
the way the mount asks them to. They expose a blob to every repository the caller may
read **once some manifest references it**; until then the upload sits in the repository
it was sent to, invisible from everywhere else. JFrog Artifactory is the one to know
about.

`deduplicated_push_content=blobs_and_artificial_manifests` is for those: after
uploading a shared blob to its home repository, the deploy also uploads a config blob
and creates a manifest referencing the two, in the same repository. The blob is then
shared, so go-containerregistry's own existence check
(`HEAD /v2/<destination>/blobs/<digest>`, which it makes before every layer upload)
answers `200` in every other repository and the layer is skipped — **with or without a
mount**. The mount request is still sent and still used where it works.

```bash
common --@rules_img//img/settings:deduplicated_push=best_effort
common --@rules_img//img/settings:deduplicated_push_content=blobs_and_artificial_manifests
common --@rules_img//img/settings:deduplicated_push_blob_repository=team/_blobs
```

That is the combination to reach for on such a registry: a repository to keep the
shared blobs and their manifests in, and `best_effort` so that a registry which turns
out not to share them after all costs the deduplication rather than the deploy.

What is written, per shared blob, is a real manifest rather than a plausible-looking
one — a registry strict enough to demand a manifest before sharing a blob is not one to
hand a malformed manifest to:

- a single-layer image manifest whose layer descriptor is the blob's own (media types
  stay in one family: an OCI manifest for OCI layers, a Docker schema 2 manifest for
  Docker ones);
- a config blob recording that layer's uncompressed digest (its *diff id*), taken from
  the config of the image the layer really belongs to, with `os` and `architecture` set
  to `unknown` — the convention for a manifest that is not meant to be run. A blob with
  no diff id to record (an artifact "layer" that is not a filesystem changeset, say a
  ztoc or an SBOM) gets `{}` as its config instead of an invented one;
- one annotation naming the blob it was written for, so whoever finds the manifest in a
  repository can tell what it is.

Everything about it is derived from the blob and its diff id, with no timestamp, so
re-running a deploy finds the same manifest already there and writes nothing. It is
written inside the same single-flight as the blob upload, so however many deploys of one
`img deploy` process share the blob, one of them writes it and the rest do neither.

The manifest is pushed **by digest and left untagged**, because it is not something
anyone should resolve by name. The caveat that comes with that: a registry policy which
deletes untagged manifests can undo the blob's visibility along with it, so keep the
blob repository out of such a policy's way.

Like every setting here it is also a per-target attribute
(`deduplicated_push_content` on `image_push` / `image_push_spec`, where `auto` defers to
the flag), and `img deploy --deduplicated-push-content=blobs|blobs_and_artificial_manifests`
overrides both.

### Pinning the home repository
`deduplicated_push_blob_repository` names the repository every shared blob is uploaded
to and mounted from, instead of letting the deploy work one out per blob:

```bash
common --@rules_img//img/settings:deduplicated_push_blob_repository=team/_blobs
```

It wins over all three sources above — including the two that would have cost no upload
at all — because the reasons to name a repository are reasons to use it every time: one
place to find, retain and clean up shared blobs, and one repository a credential has to
be able to read for the mounts to work (a token scoped per destination repository can
never mount out of a sibling service's repository). The cost is that blobs which were
mountable for free are uploaded there once.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- A blob only one repository needs is uploaded to the pinned repository and mounted from
  there too, so this is not a no-op for a single-image `bazel run //:push` the way the
  unpinned strategy is.
- The mount is *strict* (this deploy put the blob there), unless the operation asked for
  `best_effort`.

If two operations of one deploy pin the same blob to different repositories, the
lexicographically smaller repository wins for that blob and the conflict is reported on
stderr: one home per (registry, blob) is structural, because the manifest push sees one
view of the blobs per registry.

Like the settings above, it is a per-target attribute as well
(`deduplicated_push_blob_repository` on `image_push` / `image_push_spec`, where the
sentinel default defers to the flag and `""` forces "no pinned repository"), and
`img deploy --deduplicated-push-blob-repository=<repo>` overrides both.

### Mixing destinations
Whether a blob can be cross-mounted is a property of the *destination*, so the
setting is recorded per push operation and travels with it. One deploy can therefore
push some images to a registry that cross-mounts blobs and others to a registry that
does not:

- The operations that opted in are planned **together**: a blob several of their
  repositories need is uploaded once and cross-mounted into all the others, across
  operations.
- An operation that did not opt in is pushed exactly as it would be with the flag
  off. It is never handed a layer it is expected to mount, and it never contributes a
  repository for the others to mount from — so a registry without mount support
  cannot fail a deploy that also targets one with it.

A layer shared between the two groups is therefore uploaded twice: once for the
opted-in group, and once by the operation that opted out.

### What it does not touch
- **A blob only one repository needs.** There is nothing to mount it into, so it is
  left to the ordinary manifest push. A single-image `bazel run //:push` therefore
  behaves exactly as it would with the flag off.
- **Config blobs.** go-containerregistry uploads an image config from an in-memory
  layer that cannot be cross-mounted, so each destination repository gets its own
  copy. Configs are per-image and tiny, so there is nothing to deduplicate.
- **Anything in another registry.** A blob several registries need is planned once
  per registry, so the same layer can be mounted out of a repository one registry
  already serves and uploaded-then-mounted in the next. What it never does is ask one
  registry for a blob in another (see [above](#registry-requirements)), so a deploy
  mirroring the same images to two registries pays one upload per registry rather than
  one per repository.

### Interaction with other settings
- **`push_at_build_time_blob_repository`.** When push at build time staged every
  blob into that repository, it is recorded in the deploy manifest and is used
  instead of a destination repository as the home — after the two upload-free
  sources above, which are cheaper still, and after
  [`deduplicated_push_blob_repository`](#pinning-the-home-repository), which is not a
  guess about where the blobs are but an instruction about where to put them.
- **`forbid_layer_push`.** The upload phase is skipped entirely: the blobs are
  expected to be in place already. The existence check and the strict mounting still
  apply. Nothing is uploaded, so nothing writes artificial manifests either —
  `blobs_and_artificial_manifests` has no effect (and says so on stderr); whatever put
  the blobs in the registry has to reference them too.
- **`--sink` turns it off.** A sink captures the operations locally, so there is no
  registry to ask what it already has and no repository to cross-mount between. All
  three settings are ignored rather than rejected, so a `.bazelrc` that enables them
  does not get in the way of dumping an image to a tarball — the same way `--sink`
  already bypasses the push strategy and the build-time staging repository.
- **Not compatible** with the `bes` push strategy (the syncer performs the push) or
  the `cas_registry` strategy (blobs are committed to the CAS registry instead of
  uploaded). Both are rejected up front, because both mean the deploy manifest asked
  for two mutually exclusive things.

## Remote Cache Eviction

The lazy and CAS registry push strategies stream blobs directly from Bazel's
remote cache (CAS). If a blob is evicted from the CAS before the push runs, the
push will fail and the layer bytes cannot be recovered.

The eager push strategy is immune to this failure case.
It adds all required blobs to the runfiles of the push target, so the push works
fully offline even if the remote cache is unavailable.

The safest approach is to use `bazel run` on the push target directly — the push
happens immediately after the Bazel invocation, so all required blobs are probably
present. If the push happens later, make sure to consume the blobs soon after the build.

For the CAS registry the exposure outlasts the push: an image it has accepted stops
being pullable once the CAS drops a layer underneath it.
[`--cas-keepalive`](#bounding-what-the-registry-keeps-and-keeping-blobs-alive) keeps the
registry asking the cache about the blobs its live manifests name.

## Digest Function

Every strategy that reads blobs from Bazel's cache requires Bazel's digest
function to be **sha256** — which is the default. Do not set Bazel's
`--digest_function` startup flag to anything else (`blake3`, `sha1`, …) when using
one of those strategies.

The reason: Bazel's remote cache (CAS) and a container registry are both
content-addressed stores, and rules_img looks a layer up in the CAS under the very
same digest the registry knows it by. That only works while both sides hash with
the same function. Both ecosystems default to sha256 — but OCI registries are
effectively pinned to it, while Bazel's digest function is configurable, so
changing it on the Bazel side breaks the mapping.

| Strategy | Requires `--digest_function=sha256` |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Eager | No — all blobs travel in the push target's runfiles, the CAS is never consulted |
| Lazy | **Yes** — missing blobs are streamed from the CAS by digest |
| CAS Registry | **Yes** — the registry serves blobs straight out of the CAS |
| BES | **Yes** — the BES backend assembles images from CAS blobs |

The same requirement applies to the other blob sources that are addressed by
digest:
- the [local blob cache](#local-blob-cache) and the local Bazel disk cache
  (`IMG_DISK_CACHE`), which are looked up as `cas/<sha256>`, and
- the CAS references inside [compact layers](compact-stream.md): during a lazy
  push the layer's input files are fetched from the disk / remote cache by their
  content digest.

[Push at build time](#push-at-build-time) is *not* affected. Those actions receive
the blobs — and, for compact layers, the content-addressed input directory — as
regular action inputs, so they never look anything up in the CAS themselves.

### Symptom
With a non-sha256 digest function, the push fails while resolving a layer, and the
remote CAS line of the blob-source report says the blob is not there:

```
Error during deploy: building VFS: locating source for layer with digest sha256:eda6250a… …
layer with digest sha256:eda6250a… not found in any source:
  …
  - remote CAS: [blob missing] blob not found in remote CAS
```

The blob *is* in the CAS — just under a different (e.g. BLAKE3) digest, so
rules_img cannot find it. If you hit this, remove the `--digest_function`
override, or switch the affected targets to the eager strategy.

Supporting Bazel's other digest functions is tracked in
[issue #690](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_img/issues/690).

## Choosing the Right Strategy

| Use Case | Recommended Strategy | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| Local development | CAS Registry | Fast iteration, minimal bandwidth |
| Small team CI/CD | Lazy | Good performance, simple setup |
| Large organization | BES | Maximum scalability, centralized control |
| Simple deployments | Eager | No infrastructure requirements |
| Air-gapped environments | Eager | Works without external dependencies |
